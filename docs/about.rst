About

Disclaimer
----------

Naggum doesn't aim to be yet another Common Lisp or Scheme or whatever
implementation. Instead, we are trying to deliver a modern Lisp dialect that
makes use of most of CLI benefits.

Features
--------

Naggum provides both direct access to low-level features of CLI, and allows its
user to define types and functions just like any other high-level language. At
the same time, it combines power of Lisp-inspired metaprogramming (macros) with
strictness of strong-typed language.
