Naggum [![Status Enfer][status-enfer]][andivionian-status-classifier] [![Build status][build-status-appveyor]][appveyor]
======
Naggum (named in honor of [Erik Naggum][eric-naggum]) /(is|will be)/ a Lisp
dialect based on Common Language Infrastructure (aka .NET Framework / Mono).

## Disclaimer

Naggum does not aim to be yet another Common Lisp or Scheme or Emacs Lisp or
whatever implementation. Instead, we are trying to deliver a modern Lisp dialect
that makes use of most of .Net's benefits.
