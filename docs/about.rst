Disclaimer
----------

Naggum don't aim to be yet another Common Lisp or Scheme or whatever
implementation. Instead, we are trying to deliver a modern Lisp dialect that
makes use of most of CLI benefits.

Features
--------

- low level and high level features coupled together
- full support of all low-level features available on CLI (work in progress, see
  `#36`_ for details)
